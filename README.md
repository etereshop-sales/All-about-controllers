### ‚û§ Accessing and Updating Files on the SD Card

####  Typical Files Found on the SD Card

* **Effect files:**  
  `S1.txt`, `S23.txt`, etc.  
  >  These must start with **"S"** ‚Äî this is a required format for the controller to recognize them.

* **Configuration file:**  
  `config.txt`  
  > Used to set parameters like **brightness**, speed, etc.

* **Log file:**  
  `log.txt`  
  > Automatically created each time the controller starts.  
  This confirms that the controller is functioning correctly.

Example for adjusting brightness:
 1. Open config.txt and locate the line: led.brightness = XX%.
 2. Change XX% to your desired value (e.g., 100% for maximum brightness).
    
 Note: Higher brightness shortens the operational duration


### ‚û§ File Updates

To update or replace the effect or configuration files:

1. **Copy** the downloaded or updated `.txt` files to the SD card.
2. After copying, **safely eject** the SD card adapter from your PC or laptop.
3. **Remove** the SD card from the adapter.
4. **Insert** the card back into the controller until it clicks securely.

> This ensures that all file changes are saved correctly and the controller can read them on startup.
