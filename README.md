<summary><strong>NODEMCU-V2 CP2102 2-Button Controller Guide</strong></summary>

This instruction provides essential instructions for using the **NODEMCU-V2 CP2102** controller with two-button effect switching. It covers SD card use, file formatting, connections, and button behavior.
It includes how to manage the Micro SD card, connect the controller, use control buttons, and update files.

## 1. System Description

The control system includes the following components:

* **NODEMCU-V2 CP2102 controller**
* **Micro SD memory card**
* **Connectors** (type and quantity may vary depending on product)
* **Two physical control buttons** for switching lighting or visual effects
  
<em>Micro SD card</em>
![Box](images/MicroSDcard.jpg)

First of all, please use a memory card with a capacity of up to 32 GB‚Äîanything larger won‚Äôt work. It should also be a Class 10 card, meaning a high-speed one. Once you‚Äôve purchased the card, you‚Äôll need to format it to the FAT32 file system: [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M70LqYyvp_A)

The Config.txt file contains the settings. Without this file, the helmet will blink red. It will also blink red if it can‚Äôt read the card (which is what happened with your 64 GB card), or if there‚Äôs an issue with the controller that prevents it from reading the card at all

## 2. Micro SD Card: Usage Instructions

### ‚û§ Inserting and Removing the Micro SD Card

To **remove** the card:

1. Gently **press the card inward** until you hear a click.
2. The card will partially eject and can be removed.

To **insert** the card:

1. Ensure the card is properly aligned.
2. Push it into the slot until it clicks into place.

> **Important:** Always handle the SD card gently. Insert/remove only when the controller is powered off.

### ‚û§ Accessing and Updating Files on the SD Card

After removing the card from the controller:

1. Insert it into a **card reader adapter**.
2. Connect the adapter to your **PC or laptop**.
3. The SD card will contain several important files.

![Box](images/insert_card.png)

![Box](images/micro.png)

####  Typical Files Found on the SD Card

* **Effect files:**  
  `S1.txt`, `S23.txt`, etc.  
  >  These must start with **"S"** ‚Äî this is a required format for the controller to recognize them.

* **Configuration file:**  
  `config.txt`  
  > Used to set parameters like **brightness**, speed, etc.

* **Log file:**  
  `log.txt`  
  > Automatically created each time the controller starts.  
  This confirms that the controller is functioning correctly.

Example for adjusting brightness:
 1. Open config.txt and locate the line: led.brightness = XX%.
 2. Change XX% to your desired value (e.g., 100% for maximum brightness).
    
 Note: Higher brightness shortens the operational duration


### ‚û§ File Updates

To update or replace the effect or configuration files:

1. **Copy** the downloaded or updated `.txt` files to the SD card.
2. After copying, **safely eject** the SD card adapter from your PC or laptop.
3. **Remove** the SD card from the adapter.
4. **Insert** the card back into the controller until it clicks securely.

> This ensures that all file changes are saved correctly and the controller can read them on startup.

## 3. Connecting the Controller to the Device

Connect the controller's connectors to the corresponding connectors on the device. Make sure the plug type and pin count match exactly to avoid malfunction.

Supported connector types include:

* **JST SM 3-pin**
* **JST SM 4-pin**
* **GX 16 ‚Äì 10-pin**
* **GX 16 ‚Äì 8-pin**

## 4. Using Control Buttons

The controller is equipped with **two control buttons**:

* One button cycles **effects forward**.
* The other button cycles **effects backward**.

> üìè The length of the wires varies:
> * Standard length: **1 meter**
> * Compact version: **150 mm**

### ‚û§ Operation

* Pressing a button **once** changes the current effect by **one step** (either forward or backward depending on the button pressed).

<summary><strong>Instructions for using DMX controllers</strong></summary>

## Description

![Box](images/Pic1.png)

The controller is a small box. Each controller has its own number of connectors, depending on the product.

![Box](images/Pic2.png)

connectors

An encoder and 2 buttons are used to control the controller.
LAN and XLR outputs are located on one of the side panels.

On the second panel there are 2 switches, the output of SD cards, the output of connectors.

## Configuring the DMX control

In order to configure the controller to work on DMX, you should do the following:
1.	Connect the controller to the product
2.	Put the switches on the panel in position 2 (Fig.5)
3.	Connect the XLR wire to the needed XLR output
4.	Download the corresponding file to the SD card of the controller marked with the number 1 config.txt (Fig.6), as well as files with effects (if they are not there).

> Note: each product has its own folder with all the files in which all the necessary files are located.

Configure the controller to the corresponding  DMX address.

To configure the DNS address on the controller, follow these steps:
1.	Press the encoder 1 time. This action will bring the screen out of the sleep state
2.	Press the encoder again to enter the menu.

3.	Select  "DMX Address" and click again on the encoder. With these actions, we get to the settings section for the DMX address.

DMX address settings menu

To move through the menu, we use the encoder by turning it clockwise or counterclockwise. The selected position is highlighted with a white background.
Go to the DMX Address position and click on the encoder. Twisting the encoder, we select the address we need.
Note: OFF - disconnects the transmission.
Click on the encoder again to fix the selected address.
Turning the encoder, click "SAVE" and click on the encoder again.
A save window will appear after which the start screen will appear again

Then you can send effect numbers using your own equipment to the selected DMX address. On the screen, in point "Effect", the number of the effect that is currently being played will be displayed.
Note: 255 is the number of the BLACKOUT effect.
Note: The screen and encoder are only used for DMX settings. Also in the settings menu, in addition to the address, you can adjust the screen contrast and screen timeout.
